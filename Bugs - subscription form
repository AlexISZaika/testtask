Bugs and improvements that need more analysis: 
1)	I don’t know what is that and what it should do. Need to check it in documentation and ask the question to PM or PO 
2)	Why Billing Address field is absent on mockup. In my opinion it should be just for UX. OR/AND need to add email address instead. (Of course if user was not logged in earlier in the application or on the website)
